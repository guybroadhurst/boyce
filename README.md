## General info
This was the fourth project on the [Superhi Foundation](https://superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) course. It introduced different forms of layout and positioning, including absolute and realative positioning. As well as introducing CSS flexbox and how to use it. The site had a couple of nice features involving hover overlays, transforming the images and adding the titles when you hover on a specific artwork.
